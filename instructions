1. Find GDP and Merge it with the recession (Quarterly)
2. Pull together a each index index that are common, and plot the GDP, with the Stock index, and recession

3 Feature Extraction Processes (Only for All of the Data):
  - Go off Correlation only (top 5)
  - KBest Features(test = ANOVA, K = 5)
  - PCA and/or LDA --> 5 Features

Tackling Models (3 Groups: Macro Only, Micro Only, All of the Data):
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - LSTM

Compare 2 Countries:
  - Canada
  - Japan / China



Presentation:
- Title (Avaneesh)

- Main Question (Can we really use Stock Market Data and Macro Data as an indicator to predict Recession?) (Avaneesh)
    - Which factors Contribute most to predicting a recession?
    - Can Macro and Micro data solely predict a recession?
    - Can we generalize America's model against other similar countries?
    
- Why this project and purpose? (Avaneesh)
    - What is a Recession
        - What Economists Define it as and what usually contributes to it
    - Well studied and economists have counted indicators for many years, so by taking tis class, we wanted to try to see if it is even possible with ML
    - COVID Times, so this was another curiosity
    
- Design and EDA (Preparation and Cleaning of Data) (Avaneesh)
    - What features did we select?
    - Why did we do monthly, and what did we do for Data that had NaN
    - Got our data from the FRED API and Yahoo Finance
    - Took Percent Change and why
    - etc...
    
- Learn and Visualize the Trends and Distributions of our Data (Jeremiah)
    - Add the Line Graphs and Histograms and talk about them
    
- Feature Extraction and Engineering (Jeremiah)
    - Explain our 12 feature extraction processes and why and how we went about it 
    - Show the chart: Seperated for Micro Macro and RAW AND PERCENTAGES
    - ANOVA, Correlation, PCA
    - PCA Charts and Correlation Charts
    
- Model Selection: (Thaenraj)
    - Varied Models (Logistic, Random Forest Ensemble and Decision Based, and SVM)
    - Cross Validation
    - Tuning the Hyperparameters
    - Keeping the extraction techniques consistant for all models, so comparasion would be unbiased
        - We kept all the tables aside, and fit and tested consistantly, so we kept the same design
    
- Results (US Results): (Mathew)
    - Add the DataFrame picture
    - Talk about the best performing model (Accuracy, false and true positives, AUC, ...)
    - Explain why we think these outcomes happened
    
- Results (Canada Results): (Thaenraj)
    - Using the Macro because Micro will vary
    - Talk about why we cant generalize America's Model to other countries
    
- Conclusion (Mathew)
    - Yes
